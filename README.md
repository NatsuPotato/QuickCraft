# QuickCraft
QuickCraft is a 3D tile engine written in C inspired by Minecraft with a focus on speed and modularity (for modding!).

## Planned Features
- 32Â³ cubic chunks
  - Chunks store a block palette (allowing for virtually unlimited block types), block metadata (maybe), and block entities (not actually entities idk)
- Modding in WASM from compiled C
