QuickCraft is a 3D tile engine written in C inspired by Minecraft with a focus on speed and a module-based infrastructure.

im just gonna use bytes as block IDs (max of 256) for efficiency. all blocks are loaded at compilation time, so you can compile the base game + any mods together into one executable
